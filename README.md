# FourD Admin
A 4D Database Admin Web App.

This web app is built upon the [TeamMaestro](https://github.com/TeamMaestro/angular-native-seed) Angular seed.

This web app allows users to directly browse a 4D Database back end and create/edit/delete records. It also provides a 4D Choice List Editor.

**Handle with GREAT CARE.** The app already validates that user has **_Admin_** privileges, but **I'd be VERY CAREFUL making this web app available on a production site!** **MOST SPECIALLY ON A PUBLIC ACCESSIBLE WEB SITE.** It is great for development and testing, though. 


And do not forget to look at additional, more detailed, documentation on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/fourctv/fourdadmin/wiki).

It relies on Pascal's [4D RESTApi](https://github.com/fourctv/FourDRESTApi) being installed on the 4D Database backend.
